## What is a ReadMe file?

A README file in a project (including those projects hosted on GitHub) is written by people (project developers) for other people to read. 
* It is, simply, the “front page” of the project; the “place” where everyone gets started. 
* It usually describes what kind of project it is, how it can be useful, how to install and use it
* also, the list of authors, guidelines for contributing, license notice 
* and whatever else the developers would want other people to read.

## Formatting

Git is written in markdown language, this is similiar to HTML (Hyper Text Markup Langauage) in fact you can edit this with HTML syntax
> Try and stick to one type where possible.
